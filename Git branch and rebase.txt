Branches are used in github to differentiate between two process.
It is used for parallel processing, where data is stored in respective branch.
This feature becomes usefull when we want to work on different features of an application at a time.
Now when we want to add the changes of one branch to other then we can use merge or rebase.


Merge and Rebase both retrive same output,but when we process the data through rebase its look that they are processed serially rather than parallely. 
Rebase can also be used for intractive process by rebase -i where we can edit the commit message, squash the commit message.
